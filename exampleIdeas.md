# Possible Final Project Ideas
These are not required projects, but merely examples of possible projects. Be creative! We would suggest using these as a 'jumping off point.' Your project should be equal or more complex than the following. Remember, you can always pass ideas past us, and we will give you feedback on it.

## COVID-19 Processing
Process data about some aspect of the virus. Many sources online have raw data files about testing, infection rates, spreading or close downs. Create a program that reads in data and processes it in some interesting way.

## Text-based model/simulation
Implement a program that simulates a real-life scenario. Examples are simulating an airport, air traffic scheduling, processes of a hospital, a manufacturing floor, elevators in a skyscraper, a physics problem, a biological model, a societal or anthropological issue, scientific problems.

## Interactive tutoring project
In CS-171 you may have implemented parts of an interactive math tutoring program. Redesign this using Classes/Objects and other advanced concepts you learned this semester. Perhaps you will like to keep track of studentâ€™s progress/scores in files, read and present questions from different topics from files, etc.

## A Business application
For instance, a system might use a number of files and calculate profits (as per purchases, sales, expenses), might calculate payroll, keep track of bank accounts, etc.

## Other Fields of study
Explore implementing a software solution to an advanced problem in your other classes, i.e. math, chemistry, physics, journalism, etc.

## Data Structures
Consider a project involving more advanced data structures from Chapter 20 and beyond (e.g. linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables/dictionaries, binary trees, etc.)  

## Game
A text-based Game of your choice. Or add animated elements using cout statements.

## Machine Learning
Now that you know how to deal with files, create a document classifier. Create a program that will be able to detect two different kinds of text. As an example: sports journalism vs. political journalism. You can train your classifier by feeding it known (or labeled) documents. One of the base forms of classifiers is the count the number of occurrences of words in a document and compare it to an average for that kind of document. Basically "baseball" should show up, on average more in a sports article than a political one. Same thing with "representative" showing up, on average, more for political articles.

__NOTE__: it is also possible to enhance and expand your CS-171 final project or a project for a different class/event. In that case, you must make a good case with us before hand. This expansions should significantly change the original code with the more advanced concepts that you have learned this semester. Talk to us!
