## Deliverable

I updated your file, thanks for including that so I could see with current data.

Uh oh... there is an error somewhere. Ah, because you don't sanitize the input. There are null fields in the data that you hand set to zero.

Wait, why would I check the png? You are not generating pngs, those are generated outside your code right?

Why are you pushing back empty objects?

Don't use `break` that is just sloppy.

This is a lot of copy / paste code. You are doing the same thing over and over again. This could be handled much more efficiently if you would have used the polymorphism you set up, or made a better container class. You can easily develop different operator< methods that change in between sort calls. This would have significantly cleaned up your code.

I am a little bummed that you didn't do anything else. It would have been cool to ask the user for a sort. Or something like a prompt to get into all that data.

I know that you spent a lot of time on this, but that looks like it was spent dealing with this code that you copy/pasted around. Better design from the beginning would have saved you time and given you more detailed options on what you could do once you read this in.

At the end of the day this is very similar to the baby names problem with a couple more 'columns' instead of just two.

## Documentation

Code: fine.

I have some issues with your graphs (just that they are hard to interpret / understand). Why are they all different? WHy not make them the same. The data is interesting enough! The fact that you have data visualization is awesome!

I would like to see more about how you are calculating all of this! There is sorting going on, so how are you sorting it?

## Presentation

I don't love that you are reading off of your documentation. I can read your documentation, but I want you to walk me through it!

It would have been nice to get more information on the top level idea of the program before just going through the methods. Like "Woudn't it be nice to sort through all this data? My program takes raw COVID data and outputs something like this:..."

Interesting update of information.

Lol, it looks like you sorted everything, probably don't need to specify that!

How are you computing all of this!? that is the interesting part! How did you get infection rate?

This is a good overview.

### Presentation Feedback

(a side note about your feedback: you received way more than anyone else due to a formatting error in our emails we sent out. I thought I would keep them in here as the info is still good! Just a lot)

#### What is one thing you really liked about this project?
* Very helpful and applicable in these times
* I like how he used a current issue and is outputting important information, I also like the graphs and charts.
* It provides up to data stats on a current issue...very relevant. I also think that the addition of the graphs was a good idea. I'm curious if those were generated by the program or if you got them from an outside source. Your functionalization was great.
* There was clearly a lot of attention to detail and a lot of thought put into this project
* I really liked how visuals were added to help illustrate the data
* The use of ten different txt files and being able to update them
* This is a great subject you chose to do for your project. I also really liked your presentation and data tables you provided at the end.
* The program was very detailed and well organised
* It looks like a really well done use of code
* His idea of giving us more information about the Coronavirus is very creative. I love his humanistic purpose for doing that.
* I liked the documentation file with everything organized. It provides a good guideline on what the project is about.
* The graphs they included in the .md file!
* I found it interesting how this project implemented actual data in its execution; it felt like this code was created in a very practical manner, which I really liked.
* I loved loved loved the use of the statistical graphs in his project. Really impressive
* I like the topic of the project. As we all know, the Covid-19 crisis has hit everyone hard, so being able to apply knowledge we've learned to real life scenarios is really cool! Also, the visual added representing infection rates was pretty cool!
* I like the practical implications of this project, and that he included graphs of the data. The presentation was easy to follow, and the explanation document was very well formatted.
* This project is relevant to current crisis of COVID-19 and can we used to formulate data to analyze current stats. This program has a good information giving perspective.
* Graphical representation of the data is really good. This can be used by various website which represents COVID related information.
* I really liked the visuals that were added, it made all of the output readable.
* The tables and graphs and usage of binary search
* The use of Binary sort to sort the data for each category. (ex. total cases per country, etc.)
* I liked the relevant application and inherited/base classes.
* It has many informations that we could see and also it's clever to add the cases in one day.

#### What is one thing you would change / modify / add to the project?
* Statistic analysis, global averages
* Some how get daily case information automatically and update it from there
* It seems like there is a lot of processing of data from the internet. You could possibly add more code to manipulate and add value to the data.
* It's hard to tell from a 5-minute presentation, but it seems like there are a lot of individual header files and classes that perhaps could have been combined to simplify the organization.
* I would add a function to display the total current percentage of death to infected ratio on the screen after the total deaths and total infections
* I would make the organization of the file headers clearer
* I would have liked to have seen more of the code/inheritance/polymorphism in action.
* Maybe add more information in the future. The program was well written so nothing else come into mind.
* I would love it if the statistics outputted to console from the text file was in a very nice table.
* I'm not sure if the world database and/or other records are pre-defined data or not. But, I would want to see if there could be a simulation of the Covid-19 based on the real time data
* Just "cout << endl" statements to separate the displayed text in the terminal
* I would add a prompt to where you can add more detailed information regarding cases to the different divisions of COVID 19 information
* I would add an automatic update to the data rather than asking the user how many days it has been since the last update.
* Not much. He did a great job!
* I'm not sure what the purpose in the user input was. The file I/O was reading in data for each country, but the user input just inputs one number for the total cases of the whole world? I think that adding a menu element to update each country's numbers, that also updated the total would make the program more applicable.
* I would try to add a feature that analyzes data and the checks the rate of spreading to predict future outcomes preemptively.
* I would add growth rate predictor to the program by taking previous data.
* One thing I would change in the project is making it more functionalized.
* If possible, it gets data from online directly and the data is already sorted so it is seems like already cooked
* An outline of what is being presented instead of a big code review/ demonstration.
* Modify code and output format - they look messy
* The general idea and the presentation is good. However, if he would show us the how he wrote the code and see the example of the code would be better. Perhaps the idea of the project might be simple.

#### General feedback on the project? (Not required)
* Nice work! Very interesting
* Highly impressed with the visual graphs that he included in his readme
* The project is very good topnotch. His small step of doing a project about the coronavirus is very good.
* Was very organized, especially all the sorted .csv files
* Great work!
* It's pretty good.
* It is good idea to work on current problem
* I like the idea of adding mathematical modeling to make the program more realistic!
